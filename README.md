# Playfair using JavaScript
This is slightly different than the original playfair cipher logic.
This uses 7x7 matrix instead of 5x5, this matrix enables u to use numbers and spaces which lets the message to be encrypted to use the letter 'x' or 'q' which is usually used in the encyption using the normal playfair cipher logic.
The JS logic code was made by https://github.com/Marshyy.
This contains a website in which you can encrypt and decrypt using the playfair logic.
#Directions
- Click the encrypt button to enable the input boxes in which you enter the message to be encrypted and the secretkey based on which the message is encrypted(you will need the secret key to decrypt the message).
-Click decrypt to enable the decrypt message block.
-Hit 'COMMIT' button after writing the encrypting/decrypting message and the secret key.
The message will be encrypted or decrypted and displayed in the same block where you wrote the message.
